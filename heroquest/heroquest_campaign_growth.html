  <h1>HeroQuest Campaign Progression and Character Growth</h1>

  <p>Playing one quest in HeroQuest is like watching a single episode of a fantasy TV series. But string them together, and you create an epic saga. Thatâ€™s where campaign progression comes inâ€”the long arc of heroic development, treasure collecting, and perilous missions.</p>

  <h2>What Is Campaign Progression?</h2>

  <p>HeroQuest comes with a quest book, a series of linked adventures. Each quest adds a new challenge, story beat, and often changes the terrain or introduces new rules. Characters carry what they earn from one quest into the nextâ€”just like your favorite RPG video game.</p>

  <div class="mermaid">
    graph LR
      A[Quest 1: The Trial] --> B[Quest 2: Rescue of Sir Ragnar]
      B --> C[Quest 3: Lair of the Orc Warlord]
      C --> D[Quest 4: Prince Magnus' Gold]
      D --> E[Final Quest: Return of the Witch Lord]
  </div>

  <p>Each quest builds on the last. Heroes grow stronger, but so do the dangers. Zargon introduces tougher enemies and trickier traps. Like leveling up in a game, it creates an addictive sense of momentum.</p>

  <h2>Treasure and Gold</h2>

  <p>After completing a quest, heroes often earn gold coins. Gold is used to buy better equipment between quests. Think of it like shopping after an adventureâ€”new swords, shields, armor, and tools that improve your odds in the next challenge.</p>

  <canvas id="shopCanvas" width="500" height="160" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"></canvas>
  <script>
    const canvas = document.getElementById('shopCanvas');
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.font = "14px sans-serif";
    ctx.fillText("ðŸª™ 200 Gold Coins Earned", 20, 30);
    ctx.fillText("Buy Options:", 20, 60);
    ctx.fillText("- Broadsword (3 Attack Dice): 250 Gold", 40, 90);
    ctx.fillText("- Helmet (+1 Defense Die): 125 Gold", 40, 110);
    ctx.fillText("- Healing Potion: 100 Gold", 40, 130);
  </script>

  <p>This post-quest phase is where long-term strategy comes into play. Should the barbarian save up for a battle axe? Should the wizard buy extra potions instead of armor?</p>

  <h2>Character Sheets: Growth Over Time</h2>

  <p>Each player has a character sheet where they track body points (HP), mind points (like wisdom or mental fortitude), gold, gear, and notes. It's your characterâ€™s personal story. Think of it as your heroâ€™s rÃ©sumÃ©â€”what they've survived, what they've earned, and what they're carrying.</p>

  <svg width="500" height="180" style="border:1px solid #ccc; margin-top:1rem;">
    <rect x="20" y="20" width="200" height="130" fill="#f5f5f5" stroke="#000"/>
    <text x="30" y="45" font-size="14" fill="#000">Name: Aric the Barbarian</text>
    <text x="30" y="70" font-size="14" fill="#000">Body Points: 8 / 10</text>
    <text x="30" y="95" font-size="14" fill="#000">Gold: 300</text>
    <text x="30" y="120" font-size="14" fill="#000">Gear: Broadsword, Helmet</text>
  </svg>

  <p>This progression is what makes players invested. They're not just moving tokensâ€”they're growing a character whoâ€™s part of a bigger story.</p>

  <h2>RPG-Lite Feel: Real-World Analogy</h2>

  <p>Imagine going to the gym. The first day is hard. But as you keep going, you lift heavier, last longer, and know your way around. HeroQuest is the same: the more you quest, the better you play, and the more your character can handle.</p>

  <p>The game mirrors growth we experience in life and storytelling. Heroes are forged by experienceâ€”not born legendary.</p>

  <h2>Unlocking the Next Chapter</h2>

  <p>At the end of each quest, Zargon reads a closing passageâ€”like the last paragraph of a chapter. Then the heroes prepare for the next one. These transitions create a rhythm, like episodes in a TV season.</p>

  <p>Quest-to-quest progression includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Carrying over gold, gear, and spells</li>
    <li>Swapping out items before a new challenge</li>
    <li>Choosing who leads, who supports, and what risks to take</li>
    <li>Keeping track of character wounds or losses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Summary: The Heroâ€™s Journey</h2>

  <p>Campaign play is HeroQuest's secret sauce. It's where the game transforms from fun to unforgettable. Like Frodo carrying the ring or Link finding the Master Sword, your heroes evolve over time into legends.</p>

  <p>Next, we'll explore the role of Zargonâ€”the Game Masterâ€”and how they act as both storyteller and adversary to create thrilling adventures.</p>
