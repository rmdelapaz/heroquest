  <h1>Kellar's Keep Quest Pack</h1>

  <p><strong>Kellar's Keep</strong> was the first official expansion released for the HeroQuest board game. It continued the campaign and introduced a new underground setting‚ÄîDwarven tunnels and ancient fortresses hidden deep beneath the mountains. The stakes were high, and the dungeons tighter and more dangerous.</p>

  <h2>Story and Setting</h2>

  <p>Kingdom forces loyal to Mentor are trapped in the depths of the ancient stronghold known as Kellar‚Äôs Keep. Zargon has blocked their way to freedom with orcs, abominations, and traps. It‚Äôs up to the four classic heroes to carve a path through 10 new quests and save the King's army before they're lost forever.</p>

      D --> E[10 Underground Quests]
      E --> F[Escape Route to Freedom]
  </div>

  <h2>What‚Äôs Included in the Box</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Quest Book with 10 new missions</li>
    <li>New game tiles (collapsed bridges, traps, stairways)</li>
    <li>Additional monsters (extra orcs, goblins, fimir/abominations)</li>
    <li>No new characters were added in this expansion</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This expansion focuses on challenge escalation‚Äîmore monsters, more narrow hallways, and tighter combat. Heroes will need smart positioning and teamwork to survive.</p>

  <h2>Real-World Analogy: Rescue Mission in a Collapsing Mine</h2>

  <p>Imagine being part of a mountain rescue team after an earthquake. You must explore unstable tunnels, fight off dangers, and find trapped survivors before time runs out. That‚Äôs the emotional and mechanical tension Kellar‚Äôs Keep creates.</p>

  <h2>Gameplay Highlights</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Multi-level dungeons (sometimes with stair tiles to simulate verticality)</li>
    <li>Destructive trap layouts to force alternate paths</li>
    <li>Combat-heavy design, testing gear and magic resources</li>
    <li>More frequent use of secret doors and blocked passageways</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hero Participation</h2>

  <p>The same core heroes‚ÄîBarbarian, Dwarf, Elf, and Wizard‚Äîreturn in this expansion. No new characters are introduced, but the dwarven themes of the setting give the <strong>Dwarf hero</strong> more narrative relevance. He becomes a thematic leader in the quest to reclaim and liberate his ancestral halls.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p><strong>Kellar‚Äôs Keep</strong> is the next chapter in the HeroQuest saga. It raises the stakes, pushes teamwork, and expands the world deeper‚Äîliterally and narratively. It‚Äôs ideal for players who enjoyed the base game and want a heavier challenge with continuity.</p>

  <p>Next up: the <strong>Return of the Witch Lord</strong>, an undead-themed expansion full of tombs, necromancy, and horror elements.</p>
