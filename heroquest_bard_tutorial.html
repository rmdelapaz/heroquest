            <h2>Meet the Bard</h2>
            <p>The Bard is HeroQuest's embodiment of inspirational leadership and versatile support - imagine a Renaissance polymath who combines the motivational power of a great general, the knowledge of a scholar, and the adaptability of a diplomat. Where other heroes excel through personal power, the Bard transforms ordinary adventurers into legendary heroes through music, knowledge, and the ancient arts of inspiration.</p>

                <strong>Think of it this way:</strong> If heroes were orchestra members, the Bard would be the conductor - not necessarily the most skilled at any single instrument, but the one who makes everyone else play better together. Like a master conductor who can elevate a good orchestra to greatness, the Bard's true power lies in harmonizing the abilities of others.

            <h2>Knowledge and Lore: The Scholar's Arsenal</h2>
            
            <p>Beyond inspiration, Bards possess vast knowledge of history, monsters, magic, and dungeon secrets. This intellectual arsenal often proves as valuable as any weapon or spell.</p>

            <h2>Combat Philosophy: The Supporting Maestro</h2>
            
            <p>The Bard's approach to combat focuses on force multiplication rather than personal damage output. They excel at making good fighters great and great fighters legendary.</p>

            <div class="analogy-box">
                <strong>Military Analogy:</strong> The Bard is like a modern military's command and control specialist - they coordinate air support, artillery, and intelligence to make front-line troops far more effective than they could be individually. The radio operator might not carry the biggest gun, but they're often the most valuable person on the battlefield.
